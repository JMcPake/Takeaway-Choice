# Fast Food Takeaway Simulation

This repository contains a Python script that simulates the process of choosing a fast food takeaway option based on probabilities. The script uses the matplotlib library to display a bar chart of the probabilities for each option, and then randomly selects one of the options based on those probabilities.
Installation

To run the simulation, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You will also need to install the matplotlib library. You can do this using pip, the Python package manager, by running the following command:

'''pip install matplotlib'''

# Usage

To run the simulation, simply execute the fast_food_takeaway.py script with Python:

'''python fast_food_takeaway.py'''

This will open a window displaying the bar chart of probabilities. After 10 iterations, the simulation will choose one of the options based on the probabilities and display a smiley face next to the chosen option. The statistical information for the experiment will also be displayed in a colored box.

# Configuration

You can modify the options and colors used in the simulation by editing the takeaway_options and colors variables at the top of the script.
